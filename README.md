# competitive-programming
I try to do algorithm-y/math-y things to avoid being a total "chad" type.

These mostly Python solutions(occasionally C++) of a lot of contests from DMOJ (the Don Mills Online Judge). It's basically the only judge I use, as it supports *pypy*, which allows my solutions to run considerably faster. Traditionally, contests do not guarantee problems are solvable in Python :c. Most of them are written in Python 2, which happens to be a bit faster than Python 3.

I don't bother to upload a lot of trivial problems, unless I wrote the problem or found the problem particularly good. This is anything around 5 points and under, and are problems that are very easily brute forced. The problems here are sorted by the contest, and ones that don't quite belong to a contest are listed under the site.

Problems are grouped by contest. My code is not necessarily easy to read, in fact it probably isn't but should give you a decent idea. I swear though, when I write software I lint like no tomorrow. You can always email me at `hello@carolchen.me` if you want to scold me about my variable names or convoluted solutions.
