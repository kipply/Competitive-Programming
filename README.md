# competitive-programming

These mostly Python solutions(occasionally C++) of a lot of contests from DMOJ (the Don Mills Online Judge). It's basically the only judge I use, as it supports *pypy*, which allows my solutions to run considerably faster. Most of them are meant to run in Python 2, which happens to be a bit faster than Python 3.

I don't bother to upload a lot of trivial problems from smaller contests. Contact me if you're looking for something; I'm always looking for problems to solve (`hello@carolchen.me`).

Problems are grouped by contest or by site. My code is not necessarily easy to read, in fact it probably isn't but should give you a decent idea. I swear though, when I write software I lint and follow practices like no tomorrow. Note that a variable named `cactus` represents a primary graph (adjacency list or tree), named after Brian Chau.
