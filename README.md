These mostly Python solutions(occasionally C++) of a lot of contests from DMOJ. Most of them are meant to run in Python 2, which happens to be a bit faster than Python 3. 

Solutions are all titled by problem code, or whatever I found in the URL. For the sake of SEO, contests include; CCC, CCO, Codeforces, Google Code Jam, COCI and DMOPC/DMPG. 

Problems are grouped by contest or by site. My code is not necessarily easy to read, in fact it probably isn't but should give you a decent idea. I swear though, when I write software I lint and follow practices like no tomorrow. Variables named `cactus` represent a primary graph (adjacency list or tree), named after Brian Chau. Cacti are cute.
